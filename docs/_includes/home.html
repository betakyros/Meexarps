      <div style="width: 50%;">
        Meexarps is a Jackbox style game where the goal is to learn about your friends. It will be playable on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.airconsole.com/" target="_blank">www.airconsole.com</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Welcome to planet Meexarp, homeland of the cute, intelligent alien race that is studying humanity’s greatest asset: Friendship. In the Meexarp research facility, they are finally ready to do human experimentation. The Meexarps temporarily abduct you and up to 5 of your friends as study participants to learn as much as they can about the phenomenon.
        <br>
        <br>
        You will be asked personality questions. After some processing by the Meexarp scientists, the personality questions will be anonymized! You will have to demonstrate the strength and power of your bonds by matching the answer sets back to the original personality!&nbsp;

    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>There are two pillars of Meexarps:&nbsp;Personality questions, and would you rathers.</p>

    <div style="display: flex;justify-content: space-evenly;">
      <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: column;justify-content: center;width: 50%; padding-right: 2%; align-self: baseline;border-right: 3px solid black;padding-right: 8px;">
        <h2 style="padding-top: 0px;margin-top:0px;">Personality Questions</h2>
          In this phase, one player comes up with 3 personality questions. For example:
          <br>
          &nbsp;
          <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; width: 100%;">
            <img src="https://mcusercontent.com/31cdeaf464fe421e8d20ce46c/images/205e7f90-8e4a-4455-acf2-f40f7adb9599.png" style="width: 75%; border: 15px solid; margin: 0px; border-radius: 20px;">
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          All players answer these questions and then the questions are anonymized...
          <br>
          &nbsp;
          <div style="display: flex;justify-content: center;width: 100%;">
            <img src="https://mcusercontent.com/31cdeaf464fe421e8d20ce46c/images/56bf9f27-cf68-4016-afe8-6e5b88ed18a2.png" style="border: 0px initial; margin: 0px;">
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>
          And finally, you match the personalities back to their original players!
          <br>

      <div style="width: 50%;">
        Airconsole is a virtual console where the console is in the cloud and the controllers are your phones. Think about it like Netflix for local multiplayer games. I chose to use Airconsole because I was more interested in building the game rather than the infrastructure, and Airconsole handles the infrastructure great. They aren’t perfect but if you’re looking to make a casual multiplayer indie game, I fully recommend Airconsole. I have seen no competitors create a platform like they have.
